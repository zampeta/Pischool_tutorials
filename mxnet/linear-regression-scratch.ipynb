Given a collection of data points ``X``, and corresponding target values ``y``, we'll try to find the line, parameterized by a vector ``w`` and intercept ``b`` that approximately best associates data points ``X[i]`` with their corresponding labels ``y[i]``. Using some proper math notation, we want to learn a prediction \n",

    "You might notice that linear regression is an ancient model and wonder why we would present a linear model as the first example in a tutorial series on neural networks. Well it turns out that we can express linear regression as the simplest possible (useful) neural network. A neural network is just a collection of nodes (aka neurons) connected by directed edges. In most networks, we arrange the nodes into layers with each taking input from the nodes below. To calculate the value of any node, we first perform a weighted sum of the inputs (according to weights ``w``) and then apply an *activation function*. For linear regression, we have two layers, the input (depicted in orange) and a single output node (depicted in green) and the activation function is just the identity function.\n",
